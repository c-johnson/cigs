> Quiz me on Typescript, I have an interview coming up in a couple of hours

Got it! I'll hit you with a mix of beginner to advanced TypeScript questions to make sure you're ready.
Basic Questions:

    What is TypeScript, and how does it differ from JavaScript?
    How do you define a variable with a specific type in TypeScript?
    What are interfaces in TypeScript, and how do they differ from types?
    What does the readonly modifier do in TypeScript?
    How do you enable strict type checking in a TypeScript project?

Intermediate Questions:

    Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types.
    How do you define a function with optional parameters in TypeScript?
    What is type assertion, and when would you use it?
    How do you create a generic function in TypeScript?
    What is the purpose of the keyof operator?

Advanced Questions:

    What are mapped types, and how do they work?
    How can you enforce immutability in TypeScript?
    Explain what utility types are and provide examples of Partial<T>, Pick<T, K>, and Omit<T, K>.
    What is declaration merging in TypeScript?
    How does TypeScript handle function overloading?

Code Challenge:

Can you write a TypeScript function that takes an array of items and returns a new array where each item is wrapped in an object with a unique ID? Example:

wrapWithId(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);

Output:

[
  { id: 1, value: "apple" },
  { id: 2, value: "banana" },
  { id: 3, value: "cherry" }
]

Let me know if you want more scenario-based or coding challenges!
