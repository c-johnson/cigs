Equipment needed:

- $120 for a Macbook pro wall transformer, get the expensive one (80W ?, the one with highest power output)
- $31.99 pair of lightning headphones, from 7-eleven on Broadway in Westport
- $20 long (10') lightning phone charger, from QuikTrip in Overland Park

Equipment needed (pt 2):

- Apple iPhone Pro 12, used is fine
- Apple Macbook Pro, M-series, my one saving grace.
